            <p>responsible for structuring the information in an organized way and presenting it in a context that is motivating to students.<br>
                Regardless of the content, students learn best when they are comfortable,
                have some control over their learning, and are sufficiently challenged. A
                balance of comfort, control and challenge can be difficult for distant instructors to achieve, and depends on psychosocial rather than academic strategies.
                Instructors contribute to the comfort of students by providing fast accurate
                answers to questions. Many instructors strive for a 24-hour turnaround time
                in sending students feedback on assignments, and they answer questions from
                students immediately. Students are comfortable with a familiar visual design
                in course materials. Written and electronic material should be consistent with
                few distractions, divided into short chunks. Students are more confident in the
                importance of their work when course criteria are stated clearly and are
                viewed as realistic. To give students a sense of control, instructors offer
                choices of activities and topics or they allow students to negotiate options.
                Control in distance learning often involves flexibility in scheduling activities
                and deadlines, although students need structure and prompting to keep up a
                reasonable pace of work. Students are challenged when there are high
                expectations for them to succeed at new tasks that they view as beneficial to
                them. An important aspect of student comfort and challenge is complete
                understanding of student evaluation techniques, which will be discussed in
                more detail in a later section.<br>
                Drawing from a business model of education in which students are
                consumers of services, many instructors and institutions have adopted quality
                educational service practices such as Total Quality Management. Quality
                service centers on providing learners with excellent support integrated into
                the course and systems for communication within the course (Vaughan,
                2000). The focus is on the needs of learners and the learning process, rather
                than content. The quality service approach emphasizes the course structure
                and interactions in order to supply flexible scaffolding to learners as needed.<br><br>
                Communication Practices<br>
                Because learning is an interactive activity and constructed socially, a key
                to success lies in communication between students and others. A quality
                benchmark is to involve students in communication during 50% of the time
                they spend on the course. Frequent and active communication with the
                instructor, fellow students, or experts in the subject is essential in making
                students feel that they are part of the community of learners. Connection is
                vastly more motivating than isolation. Students need to know that others care
                about them and that they are contributing to an educational endeavor larger</p>

            <p>than themselves. Instructors should strive to know students on a personal
                level, and maintain a conversational tone in all communications during
                the course.
                Interaction in a distance learning course is most effective when it occurs
                through a variety of media, when it occurs with a variety of sources, and when
                it is integrated into the overall course design. The course should offer students
                opportunities to interact through more than one media channel, and the
                student should become proficient at choosing the most appropriate channel
                for specific needs. Media channels for course interaction include email, chat,
                discussion forum, listserv, phone, audio-video conference, fax and face-to
                face meetings. Most institutions offer a range of media services and many are
                now available on the web for free. Students should be encouraged to interact
                with sources including classmates, professionals, experts, and nonhuman
                sources of information such as databases, print material and audio/video
                media. Students access such media remotely online and locally in their
                communities. Very effective learning in an online course may occur offline,
                in labs, businesses, and other settings. Interactions are most effective when
                experienced within the context of other course activities.<br>
                Communication in a course has the greatest value for students when it
                authentically approaches the kinds of communication students will experience beyond the course. Students should work in cooperative teams to solve
                realistic problems. The instructor’s role is to set up situations that approximate the professional world and require high levels of interdependence for
                success. The instructor must also model and requirire respect for student
                diversity and various learning styles.<br><br>
                Instructional Practices<br>
                Successful distance educators understand that motivation is among the
                most important factors in promoting student learning. Distance learners
                function very independently and are generally intrinsically motivated, but
                they often require extrinsic motivation to keep up their pace in a course.
                Instructors provide extrinsic motivation through course structure, communication and activities. At the outset, instructors must clearly state the benefits
                of learning the course content to the student. The course activities should
                foster both knowledge construction and content understanding through active
                learning. To succeed in the course and later endeavors, students in the distance
                education environment need education in the subject blended with information literacy and applied technical skills. The education in the subject should
                focus on higher-level cognitive skills such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation. The information literacy skills should include information retrieval,</p>

            <p>evaluating resources and communicating a viewpoint. The technical skills
                relate to the hardware, software and online applications used in the field
                of study.<br><br>
                <h3>The Results Phase of the RPR Cycle</h3>
                The only way to know whether a distance education program has
                achieved quality is to compare the program results to established quality
                benchmarks. Measures of quality are tied to institutional goals, and account
                for the specific context of the program. To maintain success, a distance
                education program evaluation must account for institutional and instructional
                factors as well as student factors. Evaluation of course and program results is
                a continual process that involves all stakeholders and requires a wide range
                of tools. This section presents evaluation strategies used for ensuring quality
                distance education programs. The strategies evaluate success through assessment of student learning, program review, and program accreditation.<br><br>
                Assessing Learning<br>
                When experiencing quality learning, students shift roles from audience
                to actors as they acquire skills and display their abilities. The display of
                student abilities is the most important result of distance education. In the
                course of developing their abilities, successful students manage their learning
                by engaging in frequent self-assessment. Because self-assessment does not
                come naturally to all students, it is helpful when instructors guide and
                encourage students to assess themselves. Instruments such as rubrics, checklists, and journals are effective tools for helping students become independent
                and responsible learners. Such assessments provide information to students
                about their strengths and about the gaps in their knowledge.<br>
                Students receive the greatest long-term benefit when they have extensive
                opportunities during a course to develop their skills in a realistic context, and
                assessment of skills should occur within that context. As professionals or
                lifelong learners, students need experience using peer review as a way of
                assessing their competencies. During the distance learning course, students
                may be grouped with others in the class or they may be directed to practicing
                professionals for feedback on their work. A peer review process known as
                360-Degree Feedback calls for reflection on student self-perception along
                with anonymous feedback from superiors, subordinates and peers (Palloff &
                Pratt, 1999). Another approach that incorporates a professional context is the
                use of portfolios of student work. Construction of a portfolio is an engaging
                endeavor that requires the habits of mind in the field of study. Portfolios are
                commonly developed using the framework of the field of study, but they allow</p>

            <p>a degree of freedom and flexibility as students showcase the range of their
                accomplishments.<br>
                Using varied assessment methods is a key to student assessment that
                gives an accurate picture of student abilities. In addition to authentic assessments that show student application of knowledge, tests may be needed to
                show student acquisition of knowledge. Constructing valid and reliable tests
                for distance education is no different from a traditional environment. The
                special challenge of giving tests and accepting other work at a distance is
                maintaining academic integrity. In a student-centered course where assignments are open-ended and require critical thinking, little cheating occurs
                (Palloff & Pratt, 1999). Instructors use multiple sources including the record
                of student dialogue throughout the course when evaluating assignments.
                Tests in a distance course may be delivered electronically via the Web or
                computer disk, or at a proctored site. Online tests can be made available during
                a specific time frame, during which all students take the test simultaneously,
                or may be monitored using videoconferencing cameras (Kearsley, 2000).<br><br>
                Program Review<br>
                Evaluation of course effectiveness by students is most useful when it is
                an ongoing feature of the course. At intervals during the course, students
                should be asked to explain their satisfaction with their experience, including
                likes and dislikes. When the course climate is open and supportive, students
                generally offer honest and constructive feedback that can be used toward
                continuous improvement of the course (Palloff & Pratt, 1999).<br>
                Participation of students, instructors and the institution is needed to
                determine the quality of the distance education program. Students should
                have the opportunity to offer feedback regarding their access to learning
                activities, course delivery, and technical support. Scope and sequence of
                courses are important factors for students, too. Student feedback is collected
                using printed or electronic surveys, narrative messages, and interviews.
                Program faculty should be asked about their experiences with course access,
                delivery and support. More importantly, faculty members need to express
                whether they have adequate access to training and development resources.<br>
                The intended program outcomes must undergo review at the institutional
                level to ensure their clarity and their appropriateness to students who move
                into work or higher learning roles. Learning outcomes for distance education
                programs should be clear to instructors and students. Achievement of outcomes in specific courses should be observable and measurable against a
                known scale or set of criteria. The methods and materials used in attaining
                program outcomes must also be included in the review. Comprehensive</p>

            <p>program review considers the quality of the course materials, instructional
                design of courses, and instruction and technical support provided to students.
                Qualitative assessments of program components, accounting for the learning
                context, can reveal patterns of student performance in relation to different
                course features. Quantitative data on student achievement and satisfaction are
                important parameters that contribute to future program success. Students and
                faculty need alternatives if they discover that a distance learning course is not
                appropriate for a student. Proper placement of students contributes to program
                success, reflecting positively on the institution.<br><br>
                Accreditation<br>
                Accreditation gives an institution a seal of quality because educational standards have been met. A student who expects a distance education course to transfer to another school must be sure that a regionally
                accredited institution offers the course. Institutions with distance education programs approach accreditation in several ways. The accreditation
                process varies according to whether a distance education program is
                offered by a high school, a traditional institute of higher education, or
                dedicated distance education provider.<br>
                Traditional institutions such as high schools, colleges and universities
                offer distance education programs to meet the needs of students and to
                accomplish institutional goals. Regional accrediting commissions generally
                accredit programs at these institutions. To maintain accreditation currently,
                distance education programs must meet the same criteria as on-campus
                programs. Most public online high schools are not currently accredited as
                independent institutions because they offer courses a la carte to students
                attending a local accredited school. The local school districts and the online
                high school reach agreement about course standards and funding. Examples
                are: Florida Online High School (http://fhs.com), Kentucky Virtual High
                School (http://www.kvhs.org), and the Concord Consortium Virtual High
                School (http://vhs.concord.org). Private online high schools seek accreditation through regional independent school accrediting agencies. A private
                online high school, Class.com is accredited through the North Central
                Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Commission on International
                Transregional Accreditation accredits Apex Learning.<br>
                The eight bodies that accredit colleges and universities in the US have
                released a draft of Guidelines for the Evaluation of Electronically Offered
                Degree and Certification Programs. The guidelines address institutional
                activity in the areas of institutional context and commitment, curriculum and
                instruction, faculty support, student support, and evaluation and assessment.</p>

            <p>he regional commissions will implement the guidelines in a manner compatible with their policies and procedures (Council of Regional Accrediting
                Commissions, 2000).<br>
                An accrediting group specifically focused on distance education is the
                Distance Education and Training Council (DETC). Since the 1950s, the
                DETC has accredited correspondence schools and nontraditional online
                programs. DETC accreditation means that quality standards have been
                met, and that students may be eligible for federal financial aid. DETC
                accreditation is not a guarantee that credit will be granted in a degree
                program (DETC, 2000). New organizations are appearing that claim to
                accredit online programs, however, many of them are not recognized by
                the US Secretary of Education or the Council for Higher Education
                Accreditation (Johnstone, 2001).<br>
                The Web-Based Education Commission has called for enhancement of
                the accreditation process in which institutions and programs participate
                voluntarily. The Commission’s goal is to provide more clarity for students
                regarding online options. The Commission recommends common standards
                and requirements for online programs comparable to standards for on-campus
                programs (2000). Disreputable accrediting bodies exist, enforcing virtually
                no educational standards. The public needs information to help them distinguish among the accrediting bodies and the quality control they provide.<br><br>
                Exemplary Case: Virtual High School<br>
                Virtual High School (VHS), operated by the Concord Consortium,
                MA, began offering online courses to high school students in 1996.
                Initially funded by a US Department of Education grant, VHS is a
                consortium of high schools that offer web-based courses for students in
                participating schools. This not-for-profit organization does not provide a
                comprehensive accredited high school diploma, but provides courses
                taught by certified teachers as part of a student’s local public or private
                high school education. As of the 2000-2001 school year, VHS serves
                4,000 students taking 150 courses in 30 states. The core program goal of
                VHS is to expand the offerings available to high school students through
                a wide range of quality, innovative online courses. The process used to
                evaluate the results of the program stems directly from the core goal.<br>
                During its four-year history, VHS has conducted reviews of its programs
                with the help of research firm SRI International. Program reviews provided
                information about program results that was critical in improving the program’s
                resources and practices. Evaluations have judged the qualifications of VHS
                teachers, the usability of the infrastructure, and student/teacher satisfaction.</p>

    <section class="pg7">
        <div class="data"><br>
            <p>The results of instructor reviews led to the implementation of a graduate level
                professional development course in online pedagogy for teachers. A panel of
                experts reviewed the quality of courses in the areas of content, pedagogy,
                design, and assessment. A Course Evaluation Board sets standards for course
                design and delivery.<br>
                The most recent review targeted the advantages of VHS relative to
                classroom courses. Quantitative and qualitative factors were included in a
                case study of four VHS courses also offered face-to-face. Comparison of
                factors such as dropout rate, content, goals, assignments, use of technology
                tools, interest in the course, assessment of course quality, and student scores
                revealed no significant differences. These findings are supported by the
                results of an analysis of 16 programs comparing face-to-face with distance
                learning at the K-12 level (Cavanaugh, 1999). However, the VHS case study
                indicated that differences exist in student interaction and community building. The students and teachers in the online courses reported less satisfaction
                in these areas than did participants in classroom courses. The program is
                addressing the need for increased interaction and sense of community through
                teacher training and improved technology infrastructure. For details on the

                With the worldwide number of Internet users expected to reach 600
                million by 2002 (Computer Industry Almanac, 2000), and the increasingly
                frequent need for employees to update their knowledge and skills to adapt to
                the rapidly changing workplace, interest in distance education will continue
                to grow. In response, distance education offerings will grow, and competition
                for students will grow. Students online have access to any online course, and
                the tools of the Web allow students to quickly compare courses. A strength of
                distance education is its potential to focus the learning process on the student.
                Courses and programs that emphasize their focus on the student’s strengths
                and needs will succeed in attracting students. In order to build their reputations and keep students, courses and programs must reach quality goals.<br>
                High-quality distance education achievement is the outcome of the
                dedication of all constituents in the continual quest for the best possible
                resources, practices and results. With increased need for new career skills and
                improvement in delivery technology, distance education students will demand evidence of quality and authenticity in distance courses. It is imperative
                that distance education providers implement and review quality benchmarks
                regarding Resources-Practices-Results in response to the needs of students,</p>

                <p>This chapter looks at factors that promote development and implementation of successful online distance learning environments from the perspectives of educators and learners. It provides an overview of current tensions
                between the requirements of the faculty, the needs of the students, and the
                forces driving the development of online programs. The work is based on the
                authors’ current research as well as past experiences in the design, development, and delivery of online distance learning environments.
